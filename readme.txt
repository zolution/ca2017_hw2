1. About the Implementation
    Simply, the sample code has already done the parsing part for us, so we have to only implement the operation and itoa parts.
    First, I use 'beq' to select the operators and do corresponding calculations. Next, for the itoa part, I passed the string with several saved registers to throw the results back to the original part. This part needs so additional calculation so the code is a little complicated.

2. About the Platform: Apple MacBook Pro with OS Sierra 10.12.6
